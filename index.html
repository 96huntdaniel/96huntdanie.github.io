											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello! I am a Scrum Master at Shelter Insurance, where I help my teams
										and our business partners deliver quality code and improve our Claims application.
										I began my career as a support engineer, and after transferring to a Scrum team
										I fell in love with the empowerment and efficiency that Agile provided. Now my passion
										is to spread those values and enable teams to become the best that they can be, and provide
										maximum value to their organization.</p>
										<br>
										<p>Outside of work, I am a husband and soon-to-be father. I love to travel with my wife, spend 
										time with our dogs, and cook. I believe that being a genuine person is just as important to 
										a team's success as any skillset.</p>

								<p class="content">Just as I try to coach the value of continuous improvement to my teams, I am also always trying to learn and improve. My education has taken me primarily down the Scrum Alliance path, where I have achieved my CSM, CAL-E, CAL-T, and CAL-O. I also stay up-to-date on current frameworks such as SAFe, although I do not hold an official certification. Other courses, such as Crucial Conversations, allow
								me to improve my soft skills such as conflict mediation and coaching. To a lesser extent, I also stay active in my technical skills (Java, HTML, SQL, etc) through personal projects.</p>
